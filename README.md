# cesql_ex

A [CloudEvents SQL Expression Language](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cesql/spec.md) engine for Elixir.

The spec for CESQL isn't finished yet, and neither is this library!
Do not use either in production!

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cesql_ex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:cesql_ex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/cesql_ex>.
